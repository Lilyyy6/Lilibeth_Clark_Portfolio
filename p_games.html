					<h3>Community Potluck</h3>
					<p>Alice</p>
					<p class="desc">The game is a short puzzle game where 
					you collect ingridients to bake a cake for the potluck. This game was 
					created as a final project in my Into to Computer Programming Class, and
					was made as the finally of a running inside joke about how Tim the Wizard 
					didn't bring a dish to the potluck, and thats why all the creatures in the 
					tutorial projects are out to get him. With the Alice hit boxes bug, some parts 
					of the game are buggy or unclear, so I made a <a href="" target="blank" class="link">complete 
					walk through of the game</a> to reference if you get stuck.</p>

					<h3>Mars Dodge Ball</h3>
					<p>Alice</p>
					<p class="desc">Play dodgeball on mars! And against computers, literally! 
					Movemet is W A S D + Space to jump and &#60; &#62; are to turn 
					perspective. This game suffers from the same hit box issues as the last game,
					also due to Alice bugs. Click the screen to shoot a ball, and click the fix button 
					in the top-right corner if you can no longer see your character, or they arn't in
					the center of the screen anymore.</p>
