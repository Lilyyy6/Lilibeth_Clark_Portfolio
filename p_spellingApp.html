			<p>I made this app to help with long distance learning for my 
			little sister. She was in 1st grade, and I wasn't home to help 
			her practice her spelling words. With this app, I was able to set
			the new spelling words for the week on Sunday before I left,
			and she could practice them.</p>
			<p>The app had three modes: learn, game, and practice test. The
			learn mode had the spelling words written and a speaker icon that
			would read the words. This way, my sister could flip through each
			word, learning what they each said.</p>
			<p>For the game, there was a speaker icon that read a word, and four
			option buttons with random spelling words (one of them was the 
			word read of course). Getting the answer correct added health to 
			the health bar, and getting the word incorrect subtracted health. 
			Once the health bar was full, the user wins, and gets app points. 
			The app points don't actually do anything, they are just collected. </p>
			<p>The practice spelling test cycles through each spelling word, being 
			read out by a speaker icon. The user can type the word in the text
			box and recives immidiate feedback on whether the word was spelled
			correctly or not. After the practice test, the results would be submitted
			to a google spreadsheet that I could check. </p>
