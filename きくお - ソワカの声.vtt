Title
00:00.500 --> 00:03.500
Voices of Svaahaa - Kikuo. >> Translated: morika; Captioned: Lilyyy6

Lyric1
00:03.670 --> 00:07.100
Weeping - Weeping - the weeping child melted.

Lyric2
00:07.300 --> 00:10.800
Angrily - Angrily - Angrily did the child burn.

Lyric3
00:11.000 --> 00:14.100
Escaping - Escaping - where did that child go?

Lyric4
00:14.300 --> 00:17.800
Within the mountain of corpses, did they hide deep within.

Lyric5
00:18.100 --> 00:21.300
Miserably, Miserably, a balloon was furnished.

Lyric6
00:21.500 --> 00:24.900
Birds - Birds - continuously pecked at it so.

Lyric7
00:25.100 --> 00:28.800
Clickety clack, did the bones rattle.

Lyric8
00:29.100 --> 00:32.200
Upon the mountain of corpses, did the insects dance.

Lyric9
00:32.500 --> 00:35.500
Footsteps clicking in delight, popping as the running hastens.

Lyric10
00:36.000 --> 00:39.200
The poor soul chanting the words of Svaahaa:

Lyric11
00:39.700 --> 00:43.100
"Where is that bad child? Where is he among us?"

Lyric12
00:43.400 --> 00:47.000
That peculiar child must be chosen from us.

Lyric13
00:47.100 --> 00:50.100
Bodily destruction - overwhelming collapse - light's decay - color's degradation.

Lyric14
00:50.200 --> 00:53.900
Complete rupture - reoccurring dismantling - recovering remission - reviving man-made calamity.

Lyric15
00:54.000 --> 00:57.800
Exhilarating destruction - reinvigorating mania - felony damage - required demand.

Lyric16
00:58.000 --> 01:01.010
A prospering svaahaa, oh gods, won't you help us?

Lyric17
01:28.900 --> 01:30.200
Aah...

Lyric18
01:30.300 --> 01:34.100
Azure skies blending into yellow, transformations in middle heaven, three points etched, a crown crossed with confusion.

Lyric19
01:34.300 --> 01:37.100 
Once more an opinion, once more the loss of life, the ambiguity of reason to the appointed sacrifice.

Lyric20
01:37.300 --> 01:41.010
Extremities, a failure mark, during the authentication of the minimum for life and its right.

Lyric20.1
01:41.200 --> 01:44.100
Ascension towards rebirth, booming towards descension, dusk's discipline, dawn's funeral session.

Lyric21
01:44.300 --> 01:48.010
Disturbance from the masses within, emotions brewing inside from conflict, like the spinning of a washer.

Lyric22
01:48.100 --> 01:52.010
Realizing feelings of impatience, the great transformation, thoughts begin to unfold from within.

Lyric23
01:52.100 --> 01:55.100
An extreme returning revelation, high classed pain, two-ton, ton-two, mingling between the etched points.

Lyric24
01:55.200 --> 01:58.900
A prospering svaahaa, which god will answer us?

Lyric25
01:59.100 --> 02:02.500
A voice of salvation rang out, delivered from the unknown,

Lyric26
02:02.700 --> 02:06.010
a voice of prayer rang out, an resonating svaahaa.

Lyric27
02:06.200 --> 02:09.900
Within the lonely mountain, it echoes and reverberates.

Lyric28
02:10.010 --> 02:13.100
Within the sorrowful mountain, we are buried.

Lyric29
02:13.210 --> 2:16.900
Foreign mutuality, revisited invasion, violating panic, steadiness of equilibrium.

Lyric30
02:17.010 --> 02:20.900
Crumbling diplomacy, ancient regression, ancestral achievement, lonely rubbish.

Lyric31
02:21.010 --> 02:24.100
Gliding defoliation, a monk's proxy, definitive purity, hastening error.

lyric32
02:24.300 --> 02:27.900
Submerging in despair, dreading in sin, reaching capacity for sensation, the pleasure for death.

Lyric33
02:56.500 --> 03:29.200
Please, grant us protection... (x7)

Lyric34
03:40.010 --> 03:46.200
It's so pitiful, we're so pitiful, aren't we?

Lyric35
03:46.600 --> 03:50.400
Our wounds have hurt greatly, that's why we died.

Lyric36
03:50.600 --> 03:54.300
That's why our laughter is immensely dreadful.

Lyric37
03:54.900 --> 04:00.900
It's so pitiful, we've always been so pitiful, no?

Lyric38
04:01.000 --> 04:03.800
It's laughable.

Lyric39
04:04.010 --> 04:08.900
Obeying and protecting, we only must do what we must by all means, leaving you extinguished.

Lyric40
04:09.010 --> 04:12.500
We have come to a decision, to erase all forms of torment.

Lyric41
04:12.600 --> 04:16.200
Though, it's unknown, unknown, unowned, unowned, unowned.

lyric42
04:16.300 --> 04:33.100
Oh gods, help us, oh gods, help us, a prospering svaahaa...

Lyric43
04:33.500 --> 04:34.100
We are always,

Lyric44
04:34.300 --> 04:48.900
pitiful, we've always been pitiful... (x9)

Lyric45
04:49.010 --> 05:11.010
That's why we have no choice.
