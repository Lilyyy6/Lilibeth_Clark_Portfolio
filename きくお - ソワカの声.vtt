Title
00:00.500 --> 00:03.500
Voices of Svaahaa - Kikuo. >> Translated: morika; Captioned: Lilyyy6

Lyric1
00:03.670 --> 00:07.100
Weeping - weeping - the weeping child melted.

Lyric2
00:07.300 --> 00:10.800
Angrily - angrily - angrily did the child burn.

Lyric3
00:11.000 --> 00:14.100
Escaping - escaping - where did that child go?

Lyric4
00:14.300 --> 00:17.800
Within the mountain of corpses, did they hide deep within.

Lyric5
00:18.00 --> 00:21.300
Miserably, miserably, a balloon was furnished.

Lyric6
00:21.500 --> 00:24.900
Birds, birds continuously pecked at it so.

Lyric7
00:25.100 --> 00:28.800
Clickety, clack, did the bones rattle.

Lyric8
00:29.00 --> 00:32.200
Upon the mountain of corpses, did the insects dance.

Lyric9
00:32.700 --> 00:35.500
Footsteps clicking in delight, popping as the running hastens.

Lyric10
00:36.000 --> 00:39.200
The poor soul chanting the words of Svaahaa:

Lyric11
00:39.700 --> 00:43.100
"Where is that bad child? Where is he among us?"

Lyric12
00:43.500 --> 00:47.100
That peculiar child must be chosen from us.

Lyric13
00:47.300 --> 00:50.100
Bodily destruction - overwhelming collapse - light's decay - color's degradation.

Lyric14
00:50.300 --> 00:53.900
Complete rupture - reoccurring dismantling - recovering remission - reviving man-made calamity.

Lyric15
00:54.000 --> 00:57.800
Exhilarating destruction - reinvigorating mania - felony damage - required demand.

Lyric16
00:58.000 --> 01:01.010
A prospering svaahaa, oh gods, won't you help us?

Lyric17
01:28.900 --> 01:30.200
Aah...
