			<p>This app is to count the amount of stars you wish on 
			during an Animal Crossing New Horizons meteor shower. 
			During the first year after the game came out, visiting other 
			player's islands through online play was very popular. Players
			would host their island on various online websites for various
			purposes, one including having a meteor shower. When a player
			has a meteor shower on their island, they can look at the sky and
			wish on the stars. For each star they wish on, up to a cirtain cap, they
			will find star fragments on their beach the next morning.</p>
			<p>The cap for stars for a visiting player is 40 stars. Entering and leaving 
			quickly is the expectation for public online island play, so overstaying 
			your welcome by not leaving after you wished on 40 stars is rude and 
			holds up the entire queue of players waiting to get into the island. 
			Keeping track of all the stars you wish on is difficult, so I made 
			this app so I can easily get my 40 stars and leave the island.</p>
